# search-algorithm-visualizer-desktop-app
a Desktop application to visualize search algorithms allowing to enter graph, weights of edges, initial node, one or more goal node, limit od depth in case of depth limited, and max number of iterations in case of iterative deepning. 

implementation of informed and uninformed search algorithms include: breadth first - depth first - uniform cost - depth limited - iterative deepning - Greedy - A star search

Graph visualizations made using networkx, PYVIS and matplot lib
UI made using PYQT5 using QT designer for designing
